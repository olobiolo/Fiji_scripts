
Experiment folders (exported from xcellence) must contain no images other than the raw photographs from the microscope.
Oher, non-image files are alowed.

Drag the script (.ijm file) to the Fiji main window. It is open in the editor window.

HOW TO PROCEED
1. open experiment folder as stack (drag to Fiji main window)
2. go to mitochondria channel
3. establish region of interest
4. run script by pressing Ctrl+R (with editor in focus) or "Run" buton in editor window

{ script starts }

0. ImageJ Options: Set Measurements
	Area, Mean
1. duplicate selection
2. stack to images
3. select window "mito"
4. gaussian Blur; radius 0.5
5. subtract background; radius 3
6. set treshold; MANUAL, user prompted
7. analyze particles; no filters, show nothing, add ROIs to manager
8. select window "gfp"
9. set LUT to Hi-Lo
10. Gaussian blur; radius 0.5
11. subtract background; MANUAL, user prompted
12. put mito and gfp into stack (in that order)
13. measure intensities of all ROIs in both channels
	measurements appear in Results window
	one row for each ROI, parent slice noted
12. remove ROIs from manager
13. split stack into individual images
14. color images (gfp: green, mito: yellow, trans: grey) and adjust histogram
15. wrap them back into a stack (gfp, mito and trans)
16. make montage with dark grey borders
17. save montage
18. close all windows except the original stack

{ script terminates }

Once the script terminates, select another ROI or switch to the next experiment.
Measurement results can be copied to an external file at any time.
